# IBM Cloud - Watson

The IBM Cloud is interesting because their services had made for be "plug and play", but we can make many customizing through [Watson Knowledge Studio custom entities and relations models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-customizing)

And the best, they have a [Python Standart Development Kit(SDK)](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk)

## *From Watson, we can use 3 API's:*  
### [Natural Language Understanding](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding)   

**They have this API that can understand any text and extract lots of information sim, such as:**

* Categories
* Concepts
* Emotion
* Entities
* Keywords
* Metadata
* Relations
* Semantic roles
* Sentiment
* Syntax (Experimental).

And they returns by callback on Json, or they can return a Json File with all the informations
